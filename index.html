          The Bee Movie is a film that shows the never ending struggle between good and evil. After Barry Benson leaves the hive and begins to talk to humans, he sees that the humans have been harvesting and eating honey without the bees’ knowledge. He finds out that bee farms exist and their only purpose is to make bees work and to take the honey from them; from Barry’s eyes humans are grossly mistreating the bees.

        When he first gets to the farm, Barry overhears two beekeepers talking: “They make the honey and we make the money” (Hickner, Bee Movie). The bees work extremely hard to make honey, so Barry is appalled that humans are greedily taking their entire life’s work. Because of this, Barry decides to file a lawsuit against all humans.   </div>

        The case is set up in a way that presents the humans as bullies and the bees as defenseless, harmless creatures. As Barry explains in his opening statement, the honey companies are “exploiting tiny helpless bees,” and back in the hive bee news anchors tell the public that humans are “packing [honey] and profiting from it illegally” (Hickner, Bee Movie). </p>
